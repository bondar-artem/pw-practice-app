### Ngx-Admin Angular 14 application from akveo.com

This is modified and more lightweight version of original application to practice UI Automation with Playwright.

The original repo is here: https://github.com/akveo/ngx-admin

Playwright key points:
- hooks
- user facing locator
- get child elements
- get parent elements
- reusing elements
- extracting value
- assertions
- auto-waiting
- timeouts (global timeout for entire tests, test timeout, action timeout, navigation timeout, and assertions timeout - only for locator assertion)
